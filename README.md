# Dotfiles
### These are my dotfiles. There are many like them but these one's are mine...

I created these to help speed up the setup process of a new (or newly formatted) computer.

**Install:**
```
git clone https://github.com/j-devs/dots.git ~/projects/dotfiles && cd ~/projects/dotfiles && source install.sh
```

**ToDo:**
- [ ] Add macos preferences
- [ ] Add brew installation of must-have applications
- [ ] Create single command install @ dots.justingaddis.com
